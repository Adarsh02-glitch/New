## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **Hybrid Movie Recommendation System** using the MovieLens dataset.  
It combines:
- **Content-Based Filtering** (based on movie genres)
- **Collaborative Filtering** (based on user ratings)

The goal is to provide more accurate movie recommendations than using either method alone.

-----------
## Dataset
I'm using movielens dataset named:
> movies.dat
> ratings.dat

## Methodology
1.Content based filtering
- Extract genres and build a similarity matrix

2.Collaborative Filtering**  
   - Use *User-Item rating matrix* and *Surprise SVD model* to compute item similar

3.Hybrid System
 - Combine the 1 and 2 to generate the Hybrid recommendation

## How to run the code 
 1. Install the requirements from the "requirements.txt".
 2. Load the datasets to your folder.
 3. Run the main file provided


Hope this worked fine. Thank you
